## Firefox-based Browser Installation
[Install from addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-album-for-youtube-music/).

For development:
 1. Temporary installation in the Firefox release version:
  1. Run `cd bin/ && ./make_firefox_xpi.sh` to build the XPI extension file
  2. Browse to `about:debugging` and "This Firefox"

## Usage
While in YouTube Music, click the extension icon. This will navigate to your album library, open a random album, and play it.

## Troubleshooting
The album will not automatically play if the site is denied autoplay by the browser. A message may be logged to console like "Autoplay is only allowed when approved by the user, the site is activated by the user, or media is muted." This can be resolved by giving the site autoplay permission in the permissions icon near the address bar.
