## Desktop Usage

While in YouTube Music, click the extension icon. This will navigate to your album library, open a random album, and play it. For long listens, head to the extension options to enable album shuffle and queue up multiple albums!

## Mobile Usage
Random Album is implemented for iOS through the Shortcuts app and [published through RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/18928/).

Android devices can install the [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-album-for-youtube-music/) within Firefox for Android. Selecting the extension from the Firefox menu. Optionally select "Open in app" from the Firefox menu to open the album in the native YouTube Music app.

## Troubleshooting
The album will not automatically play if the site is denied autoplay by the browser. A message may be logged to console like "Autoplay is only allowed when approved by the user, the site is activated by the user, or media is muted." This can be resolved by giving the site autoplay permission in the permissions icon near the address bar.
